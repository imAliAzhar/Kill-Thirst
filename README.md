This was my first ever programming project. I remember how excited I was after competing it!

As the repo description says, KillThirst is a whack-a-mole inspired first person shooting game. It features multiple stages in which the cops creep out onto us from hidden places and we have to take them out before they take us out.  Luckily for us, the cops take their sweet time to take a good aim at us. We use their slow aim to our advantage and shoot them before they could get steady. 
If we do not shoot a cop within a certain time (which is shown by a diminishing red bar), it will eventually steady his aim and take us out at which pint the game will be over. Although gameplay starts out slow enough for most people to shoot all of the cops that rise, it gradually increases in speed, with each cop taking less time to steady his aim and with more cops attacking us the same time. After a designated time limit, the stage completes and we proceed to the next one. Once all the stages our complete the game ends. The final score is based upon the number of cops that we managed to kill.
The game keep tracks of highest score as well as the score in the current game. Background music can be switched on or off as deemed fit.
